This is a test journal entry after migrating AdamHaley.com back to the Laravel project.

4:51 PM
I applied for two more Laravel jobs today and I changed in the process my website adamhaley.com back to its original Laravel state. It's back to that Laravel 10 app that I was struggling with upgrading a few months back.
