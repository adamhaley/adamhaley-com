I made some updates to my rag ingestion workflow in NAN, basically replaced the Python Flask named generator HTB get node with a simple code note that does the exact same thing in JavaScript. I feel a little better about that, although I would like to continue to build out my Python and AN support server, including adding MCP servers and whatnot. All in all, good things, good progress! Onward and upward.
