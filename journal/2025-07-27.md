So I closed out my first week on Upwork with $230 made. A humble start, but hopefully the start of something big.

8:18 PM
Continuing the journal entry: I have two clients in total so far. Marcus Dan in Europe and Brandon in the United States. I don't know exactly where he is. Marcus Dan, the relationship is going great so far. He's very easy to work with. Great client. And Brandon we shall see. I started him late in the week and haven't heard back yet.
