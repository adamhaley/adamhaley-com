So I went today to Agape for Michael Beckwith's birthday celebration with Christine. Afterwards, I called dad and then went to WeWork to work on executing the Upwork job I landed.

8:00 PM
I was nervous about executing on the Upwork job since it's my first professional N8N contract and I really want to knock it out of the park. But once I got through setting up the API keys and getting the first Zapier ZAP translated to an N8N workflow, my confidence is greatly enhanced and I feel great moving forward. I'm about to go back and create a loom video of an update for the client.
