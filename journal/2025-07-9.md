I am thinking it's a high priority with n8n to find out how to let Credentials persist. I keep running into issues where especially with GitHub and Google the credentials just randomly expire and then I have to go refresh the credential.

Updated n8n to the latest version, which appears to include a fix for credentials, OAuth, and token issues. Planning to wait and see if this resolves the persistent credential expiration problem.

Another thing I'm going to be prioritizing here with NADEN is error paths and error handling.
