I just spent a good hour or two with Cursor on Jenna's Amplified Expansion website, fixing the large breakpoint of the nav. Definitely a lot of trial and error and learning to work with the LLMs better with that. I don't know how long it was that I was in there. I'm thinking between an hour and two hours. I had two hours at the meter. I'm about to find out. And I'm gonna go eat, but time flies when you are having fun diving in to coding projects. And when I'm at WeWork Lancashire, it's just a time warp.
