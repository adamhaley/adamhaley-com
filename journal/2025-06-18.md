I updated my Rag Chatbot workflow by passing the name Space as the session ID to my Reto, achieving true multi-tenancy. Before, I was experiencing cross pollution even though it hit a different name in the Pine Convector store, because the chat memory was shared among different environments. Now that is fixed! I'm also practicing making Loom videos for my automation business.

I've begun outreach and connecting with folks around the world who need automation. I had my first Zoom meeting yesterday with a gentleman in Hungary named Oz at X Consulting. It was a nice session. I think I might've come across a little desperate in retrospect. It's just about getting the shakes out and getting the momentum going.
