Beautiful sunny day in Los Angeles again, debugging my workflows, having some issues with the GitHub node, so I'm testing this out right now.


11:34 AM
I'm about to go check my meter because I think it's been at least two hours and I don't want to get another ticket.


11:39 AM
I made it to the meter in time. I have two minutes left.


7:10 PM
This is a good day


7:11 PM
I am making headway with a voice AI agent. This, to me, is the future. It's going to replace other ways of interacting with the internet. Voice AI is the way we're all going to be doing things in the very near future.


7:15 PM
Continued journal entry. Today I refined my backup to github, backup workflows to github workflow. There is a lot of nuance with these n8n nodes that I'm learning more each time I dive into it.


7:19 PM
Continued journal: What I have slated next is a one sheet and a business card for AH media and my AI consulting offerings a UI library foundation template for my web design and completing Jena's website that doesn't sound like much but that could keep you busy for a week at least writing it down in journal form will help me focus on it
