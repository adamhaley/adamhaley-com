Today I dealt with some server upgrade challenges. There was significant activity yesterday and today related to an upgrade to either version 1.95 or 1.96. During the upgrade process, I encountered an issue with the docker container that required intervention. Rather than troubleshooting further, I made the decision to restore the server from my last snapshot to resolve the problem. This proved to be an effective solution to get things back up and running quickly.

So, of course, when I restored the server to the last snapshot, which was last Sunday, almost a week ago, half of my workflows broke. And it ended up the reddest configuration that I had done was actually in this past week. It made me realize how much I had actually accomplished in six days, but it was a double-edged sword because I had to kind of redo all that work.

And then today, once I got the Redis finally working, which I had to reopen the ports for Redis in the firewall. So that was my issue last night. Once I got that working, I was getting some hangs and lags and failure to connect from various APIs. And finally isolated that to some environment variables I had commented out in the Docker compose file.

Based on the forecast for Los Angeles, this weekend looks quite pleasant. For Saturday, expect temperatures around 75°F during the day with clear skies. Sunday will be similar with temperatures in the mid-70s and also clear conditions. Both days will have moderate winds from the southwest. Overall, it should be a beautiful weekend with no rain expected and plenty of sunshine!

I just had an issue with open weather map where it said it couldn't find the resource. It's getting an error. The way I solved it was passing allowing AI agent to pass the location and then I included the location in the prompting from the AI agent and I said to default to Los Angeles if nothing else is specified.
