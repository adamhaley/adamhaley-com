Today was a productive day of skill-building. I expanded my automation capabilities by integrating the Twilio API with n8n. I purchased a phone number through Twilio and initiated the A2P (Application-to-Person) registration process, which will enable me to send SMS messages at scale. This wasn't for any specific project, but rather to expand my toolkit for future automation opportunities. I'm planning to explore WhatsApp integration, MCP (Multi-Channel Provider) capabilities, and Twilio's new evaluation tool next. The weather in Los Angeles today is clear with a temperature of 66°F, feeling like 66°F with light winds from the southwest.

Today was productive. I expanded my n8n automation capabilities by integrating the Twilio API. I purchased a phone number through Twilio and started the A2P (Application-to-Person) registration process. This isn't for any specific project yet - I'm building up my skillset for future automation needs. Next, I'm planning to explore WhatsApp integration and Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) capabilities, along with Twilio's new evaluation tool. Continuing to expand my automation toolkit methodically.
