I am starting to get some traction on Upwork. After 18 proposals, I actually landed a gig, a small one, for $400 to translate somebody's Zapier workflows into N8N.

I am starting to get some traction on Upwork. After 18 proposals, I actually landed a gig, a small one, for $400 to translate somebody's zappier workflows into N8N. So today I actually sent 10 loom proposals on Upwork and I got another reply. It hasn't converted into an actual gig yet but it is a conversation.

I'm in John O'Catcliff's school and in that program I'm actually following a regimen to build my AI agency. The goal is to submit 10 Upwork proposals per day. That is actually easier said than done. Today's the first day that I've actually done it after trying for probably two or three weeks. Up until now it's been between three and five proposals per day. Today I did ten.
