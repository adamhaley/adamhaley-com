I am starting to get some traction on Upwork. After 18 proposals, I actually landed a gig, a small one, for $400 to translate somebody's Zapier workflows into N8N.

I am starting to get some traction on Upwork. After 18 proposals, I actually landed a gig, a small one, for $400 to translate somebody's zappier workflows into N8N. So today I actually sent 10 loom proposals on Upwork and I got another reply. It hasn't converted into an actual gig yet but it is a conversation.
