AI is thoughts without a thinker. Patterns of meaning without intent. AI needs the intention and perception of humans to be complete. Without that its just vectors and algebra.

Today was wild. I was at WeWork and I ended up spending way too much time. Trying to get Google custom search API call working with a header credential because I needed to take the API key out of the clear text JSON of the workflow so that I could get rid of the GitHub error when backing up the workflow. I ended up using my Python proxy, which loads the API key from an environment variable, and getting the API key out of the JSON, but I’ve learned a good lesson. I really don’t want these API keys in these workflows—avoid it at all costs. I also signed up for Lang Smith so that I can have some LLM observability moving forward. I also added a workflow that scrapes HNhiring.com for jobs and sends an email with jobs that match my résumé. It uses AI to do inference on that. We’ll see how it works. I probably want to add chunking into that and have a more discreet AI filtering step so that I can fine-tune the way that’s happening. I recorded another page in Avatar. All in all, very productive day even after this slow start.
