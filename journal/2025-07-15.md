Today I got my first response on Upwork. It was a message saying they were going to send their calendar. Presumably I'll be getting that tomorrow or so. I don't really know what to expect because I'm new to Upwork still. But some contact, some movement is better than none. And it's been 14 proposals to get my first message.
