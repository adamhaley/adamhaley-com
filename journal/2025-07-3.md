So there’s been a lot of talk about AI replacing developers this year and the massive productivity boost you can get. There’s one thing that I’m not here talked about much any. Developer knows that with good abstractions in the code you’re getting like 100 X 1000 X productivity boost just with that Without even bringing AI into the picture. As a naïve example, if you have a navigation on 10 pages duplicated and you have to fix a bug or make a change across all those pages, and then you make the simple architectural improvement of using an include for the navigation instead of having it redundantly across 10 pages, you just got at least a 10 X productivity boost no AI needed. So I’m not anti-AI. I’m actually embracing the new tech and trying out vibecoding and using Gemini CLI and Claude and Kerser in my workflows, but there are areas where there are areas in the workflows where there’s no improving on the productivity boost of just simple good architecture, so we can use the best of both worlds. It doesn’t have to be either or if you start with good architecture and then bring AI to the mix to give me the added productivity where the architecture doesn’t make a difference, which is probably less area than people think. So if I’m in a Laville project, there is no productivity gain I get from telling Gemini see a lie to call an artist and command versus calling it myself the art and command command takes the same amount of time to run and it really doesn’t take hardly any time to type. Especially if you use aliases if I have get aliases set up as an example I’m using three keystrokes in some cases to add to get commit to get and then push and it takes less time to just do that than it does to tell Gemini or curse or Claude to commit push to get. So what I’m illustrating here is that there’s developers we’ve always been leveraging the nature of code and abstraction to vastly multiply our productivity. The good developers are and in the ways that we’ve already been doing that AI doesn’t really enhance anything. In some cases. It was slow down however a hybrid approach moving forward I think is the most powerful. So if you’re setting up a project and you plant your architect to leverage the same instructions that have always given you power and then use AI on top of that that’s kind of where I’m looking at experimenting. Another angle another possibility is that there’s the same instructions can actually work against us if we’re using AI in our workflow, so that creates an interesting scenario now we have the question do we use abstractions or do we not use abstractions? Do we abandon the clever of abstraction that have given given us so much productivity all these years or do we keep things more imperative and lover JI in the place of you know as my example of that so if you going back to that example, if you have a navigation redundantly coded in 10 different files and you have to make a change when that change was manual it would be a big cost in productivity now using AI if you have that code in 10 different files, you simply instruct the LLM to make the change across those 10 files you’ve lost nothing. So do we rethink the relevance of things like content management systems libraries frameworks maybe Maybe it’s about having more imperative code even with a lot of redundancy and then using an LLM to manage it all such than any changes you’re not taking any hit from the code redundancy food for thought.

Discussed the balance between AI integration and traditional software architecture. Reflected on how good abstractions that boost developer productivity may sometimes be less effective or even counterproductive when using LLMs in workflows. Explored the idea that AI might handle redundancy differently, potentially shifting coding paradigms towards more imperative or redundant styles. Considered the challenge of measuring the impact of abstraction on AI performance in codebases, including ideas for benchmarks and metrics. Planned to revisit these ideas later for deeper experimentation and evaluation.
